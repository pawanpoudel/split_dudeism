…sometimes there’s a man… I won’t say a hero, ’cause, what’s a hero? But 
sometimes, there’s a man. And I’m talkin’ about the Dude here. Sometimes, 
there’s a man, well, he’s the man for his time and place. He fits right in 
there. And that’s the Dude, in Los Angeles. And even if he’s a lazy man – and 
the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
County, which would place him high in the runnin’ for laziest worldwide. But 
sometimes there’s a man, sometimes, there’s a man.”
